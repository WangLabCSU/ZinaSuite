\title{Match Samples Between Different Data Sources}
\usage{
match_samples(
  ids1,
  ids2,
  source1 = "auto",
  source2 = "auto",
  match_by = "full_id"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ids1}{First set of sample IDs}

\item{ids2}{Second set of sample IDs}

\item{source1}{Source of first set ("tcga", "ccle", "pcawg", "auto")}

\item{source2}{Source of second set ("tcga", "ccle", "pcawg", "auto")}

\item{match_by}{Method to match samples: "full_id" (default) or "barcode"}
}
\value{
List with matched IDs and indices
}
\description{
Match samples between two datasets with potentially different ID formats.
Supports matching by full sample ID or by barcode (first 12 characters).
Returns the intersection of standardized sample IDs.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
ids1 <- c("TCGA-19-1787-01A", "TCGA-B2-5641-11A")
ids2 <- c("TCGA-19-1787-01", "TCGA-B2-5641-11")
match <- match_samples(ids1, ids2)

# Match by barcode (useful when clinical and expression data use different ID formats)
ids1 <- c("TCGA-19-1787-01A", "TCGA-B2-5641-11A")  # expression data
ids2 <- c("TCGA-19-1787-01B", "TCGA-B2-5641-11C")  # clinical data
match <- match_samples(ids1, ids2, match_by = "barcode")
}
